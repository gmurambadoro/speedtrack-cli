# SpeedTrack CLI

This is a simple command-line interface script that regularly calls the `speedtrack-cli` binary to check for internet-line speeds.

The data is stored in a `MongoDB` instance and is displayed via the [SpeedTrack Full Stack](https://github.com/gmurambadoro/speedtrack-full-stack) client.

## Why am I building this?

The aim is to learn how to develop applications using the [MERN Stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) and keep up with the times.
